# Meteor Snippets

Tutorials, demos, tricks'n tips, code snippets for Meteor.js ☄️

## About this repository

This repository was created as supportive documentation to my talk at [Meteor Impact 2020](https://impact.meteor.com) conference. At the same time this is knowledge I had desire to share, I'm planning to keep documentation fresh and tidy, regularly adding more snippets. Discussions and PRs are welcome in the issues section.
